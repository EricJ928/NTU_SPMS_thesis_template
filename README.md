## Ph.D. Thesis template for SPMS, NTU

This repository is a PhD thesis LaTex template for School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). It is a fork of NTU Ph.D. Thesis template originally from [Dr. Chen Wang](https://github.com/wang-chen/thesis_template_ntu). I modified it to match the template for SPMS students.

## Notes

Thesis title, author name and supervisor name can be changed in Thesis.cls file.
